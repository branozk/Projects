Financial Engineering & Data Portfolio 📊
Welcome! This repository serves as a collection of my projects focused on Financial Technology, Log Analysis, and Automated Data Processing. My goal is to build tools that bridge the gap between raw financial data and actionable insights.

**Current Projects**
**1. Stock Data Parser**
A Python-based utility that extracts and normalizes ticker symbols and pricing data from unstructured trading logs.

Core Logic: Uses anchor-tagging and dynamic string slicing to handle variable-length data (e.g., 3-letter vs. 4-letter tickers).

Key Feature: Implements a search window (loc) that shifts dynamically to ensure efficient processing of complex log strings.

Data Integrity: Normalizes mixed-case inputs and formats raw pricing into standardized currency floats.


**Technical Toolkit**
Languages: Python (String Manipulation, Data Casting)

Tools: Git, VS Code, GitHub

Focus Areas: FinTech, Log Parsing, Data Cleaning


**Active Development: Financial Modeling & Risk**
I am currently building out the following modules focused on valuation and uncertainty:

**1. Automated DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) Engine**
The Goal: Calculate the intrinsic value of a company by projecting Free Cash Flows (FCF).

The Math: Implementing the Time Value of Money (TVM) formula to discount future cash flows using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

Feature: Will include a "Sensitivity Analysis" table to show how changes in growth rates affect the final share price.

**2. Monte Carlo Risk Simulator**
The Goal: Move beyond "best-case/worst-case" by simulating 10,000+ possible market outcomes.

Focus: Using Python's random and numpy libraries to model price volatility and Value at Risk (VaR).

Application: Risk management for stock portfolios during high-volatility events.
